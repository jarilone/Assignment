    <p>My long-term objectives include being an extremely proficient frontend engineer who could easily overcome even the most intricate problems and bring superior outcomes. I see myself as a proactive team member who will be contributing to the endeavors that are on the edge of web development and will be engineering the best UX among our customers. Moreover, I want to help my fellow learners develop their skills to become successful professionals. This is through guiding them and code-sharing projects.</p>
